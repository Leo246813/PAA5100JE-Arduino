PAA5100JE is a optical navigation chip that can serve as an optical tracking sensor to detect motion in the X-Y directions.
It is compatible to Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040, and this project adapted the SPI connection.
The microcontroller is able to calculate the displacement and tilt angle that the object has changed, and return the data
to the main microcontroller.
